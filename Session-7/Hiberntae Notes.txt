what is hibernate?
-----------------------------------------------
- hibernate is a java framework that simplifies the developement of JAVA Applications with dtabase
- It is OPEN SOURCE, LIGHT WEIGHT, ORM(OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING) TOOL
- It implements the specification of JPA (Java Percistance API)


What is ORM(OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING) Tool?
------------------------------------------------
- an ORM tool is used for data creation, data manipulation, Data Access
- it is a programming technique that maps  the object for  data to store in the database
- basically it used JDBC API to interact with Database


What is JPA?
-------------------------------------------------

- it provides creation function and standard to ORM tool
- it is available in 'javax.percistance' package having classes and interfaces


ADAVANTAGES:
--------------------------------------------------
1. open source and light weight
2. fast performance (cache are used internally)
3. Database Independent Query(HQL-Hibernate query language- it is object oriented version of SQL)
4. Automatically created tables in databse as per the class name
5. Simplifies Complex join in database
6. Provides Query statistics in Database Status

what is HQL?
---------------------------------------------------
- it is same as SQL(Structured Query Language) but it doesn't depends upon the table of databse
- instead of table name we use class name in HQL
- so that it  is independent Query Language


ADVANTAGES OF HQL:
------------------------------------------------------
- IT IS DATABASE INDEPENDENT
- IT SUPPORTS POLYMORPHIC QUERIES
- IT IS EASY TO LEARN FOR JAVA DEVELOPERS


Eg:
public class Student {

	private int id;
	private String name;	
	private String email;
	private String password;
}
